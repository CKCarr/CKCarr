## About Me
I'm a Full Stack Web Development enthusiast and currently a student at Holberton Tulsa.  I am excited to combine my technical skills with the creative process of web development. I'm eager to learn and implement innovative solutions that enhance user experiences. My goal is to contribute meaningfully to the world of web development.

I love being creative and learning new things. So I find myself loving Front-end design and user experience implementation. I also love to organize and build, hence the Back-end development suits me as well. I chose Full Stack because I have always been a Jack-of-all trades, enthusiastic to help where I can, type of person.

### Holberton HBNB
 #### This is a Holberton school project to recreate and clone an Airbnb site. We constructed and built on over the course of the trimester in 6 phases.

 <details>
  <summary><h3>Holberton HBNB v1</h3></summary>
   
- **Sprint**: AirBnB clone - The Console
  <br>
  Created a command line interpreter (Console) to manage our AirBNB clone objects.
  with this we can manipulate data without a visual interface ( like in a Shell )
  - create a data model
  - manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
  - store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
  - **Tech Stack**: Python, JSON

- **Sprint**: AirBnB clone - Web static ( directory: web_static )
  <br>
  Before developing a big and complex web application, we built the front end step-by-step.
  The first step is to ‚Äúdesign‚Äù / ‚Äúsketch‚Äù / ‚Äúprototype‚Äù each element:
  - learn HTML/CSS
  - create the HTML of your application
  - create template of each object
  - **Tech Stack**: HTML, CSS
  </details>

  <details>
  <summary><h3>Holberton HBNB v2</h3></summary>

- **Sprint**: AirBnB clone - MySQL
  <br>
  MySQL storage
  - replace the file storage by a Database storage
  - map your models to a table in database by using an O.R.M.
  - **Tech Stack**: Python, MySQL, SQLAlchemy

- **Sprint**: AirBnB clone - Web framework ( directory: web_flask )
  <br>
  Web framework - templating
  - create your first web server in Python
  - make your static HTML file dynamic by using objects stored in a file or database
  - **Tech Stack**: Python, Flask, MySQL, HTML, Jinja

### holbertonschool-monty
- **Description**: Learning objectives in C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files
The monty program runs the bytecodes line by line and will stop if either:
    - executed properly every line of the file
    -  finds an error in the file
    -  an error occured
<details><summary><h5>The Monty language</h5></summary>
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it.
  
 #### Monty byte code files
Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension. Most of the industry uses this standard but it is not required by the specification of the language. There is not more than one instruction per line. There can be any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument:
Monty byte code files can contain blank lines (empty or made of spaces only, and any additional text after the opcode or its required argument is not taken into account:
